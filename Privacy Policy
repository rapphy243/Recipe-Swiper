Privacy Policy for Snack Swipe
Effective Date: May 22, 2025
Welcome to Snack Swipe! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Snack Swipe mobile application (the "App").
Your privacy is important to us. Snack Swipe is designed to help you discover recipes, and we aim to be transparent about how the App functions.
1. Information We Do Not Collect
Snack Swipe does not directly collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. This includes, but is not limited to:

Your name
Your email address
Your physical address
Your phone number
Your location data
Device identifiers (unless incidentally collected by third-party services as described below)
Photos, contacts, or other personal files from your device
You are not required to create an account or provide any personal information to use Snack Swipe.
2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services (Spoonacular API)
Snack Swipe utilizes the Spoonacular API (a third-party service) to fetch recipe data and display it within the App. When you use Snack Swipe to search for or view recipes, the App makes requests to the Spoonacular API.
According to our understanding and agreement with Spoonacular:

Spoonacular may collect information related to the API calls made from the App. This typically includes the number of API requests made to their service. This information is used by Spoonacular for their operational purposes, such as monitoring API usage, billing (if applicable to us, not you), and improving their services.
Snack Swipe itself does not access, store, or analyze this API call count data. This data is managed by Spoonacular.
We encourage you to review Spoonacular's Privacy Policy to understand how they collect, use, and share information. You can typically find their policy at:

Snack Swipe is not responsible for the privacy practices of Spoonacular.
3. How We Use Information
Since Snack Swipe does not collect personal information directly from you, we do not use any such information.
The information collected by Spoonacular (API call counts) is used by them as described in their privacy policy. For Snack Swipe, the interaction with Spoonacular is solely to provide you with the recipe content you request through the App.
4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
Snack Swipe does not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your personal information with third parties, as we do not collect it in the first place.
As mentioned, API call data is inherently "shared" with Spoonacular as part of the App's functionality to retrieve recipes.
5. Data Security
While Snack Swipe itself does not store your personal data, we rely on the security measures implemented by Spoonacular for the data they collect (API call counts). We encourage you to review their security practices.
6. Children's Privacy
Snack Swipe is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us through the Spoonacular API indirectly, please contact Spoonacular.
7. Your Choices and Rights
As Snack Swipe does not collect personal information from you, there are no specific settings within the App to manage such data. If you have concerns about the data collected by Spoonacular, please refer to their privacy policy and contact them directly.
You can stop all information collection by the App by uninstalling it.
8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our App Store listing and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
